This directory contains files generated by H2O (https://github.com/h2o/h2o).

The files do not preserve the ordering of the pseudo headers and content-length
header due to the way the HTTP implemenation is involved in handing QPACK.

You can use the `--http` option of the `sort-qif.pl` to check if the files have
been decoded correctly, i.e.:
```
bin/sort-qif.pl --diff --http decoded.qif exepected.qif
```
